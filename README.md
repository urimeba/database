## Purpose

`DataBass` is a remote database management tool designed for students. It enables access to a personal database activated by the designated teacher from any internet-connected device, fostering an understanding and learning of the necessary tools for SQL management and administration.

The platform operates with roles for teachers, classes, and students, allowing a teacher to create different classes with various exercises. These exercises can be activated or deactivated, restricting student access accordingly. Upon submission, students receive immediate feedback and grading for their completed exercises.

Teachers can view student grades per exercise, regardless of their active status. Additionally, didactic materials are available for consultation during classes, aiding in revisiting concepts and addressing queries.

The platform allows teachers to autonomously create student user accounts by uploading a CSV file with a specific format, simplifying user management.

The SQL compiler, a pivotal component, connects to a cloud-based database to execute SQL instructions created by students. Results obtained are evaluated against criteria set by the teacher, promoting practical and effective learning of SQL.
